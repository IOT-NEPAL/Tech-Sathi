## ⚠️ Important Notes

### File Structure
```
your-repo/
├── index.html      ← Must be in root
├── styles.css      ← Must be in root
├── script.js       ← Must be in root
├── README.md
└── DEPLOYMENT.md
```

### API Configuration

- No user setup required
- Ready to use immediately after deployment

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Page Not Loading
- Check file names are exactly correct
- Ensure files are in root directory
- Wait for GitHub Pages deployment

### Styling Issues
- Verify `styles.css` is uploaded
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache

### JavaScript Errors
- Verify `script.js` is uploaded
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all files are in same directory

## 📊 Performance Tips

- Images are optimized for web

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers fully supported

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Local Storage

- GitHub Pages provides this automatically
- Local development works without HTTPS

## 📈 Analytics (Optional)

### Google Analytics
1. Get tracking ID from Google Analytics
